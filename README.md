# *PythonicPlayground*

Welcome to PythonicPlayground ! This repository is a collection of Python programming and Jupyter notebooks where I practice data mining and data analysis using Python.

## About

I have created this repository to showcase my skills in data mining and data analysis using Python. Each Jupyter notebook in this repository contains Python code and data analysis techniques that I have learned over time. I will be regularly updating this repository as I continue to learn and explore new techniques.

## Usage

You can browse through the Jupyter notebooks in this repository to learn different data mining and data analysis techniques. Each notebook is self-contained and contains detailed explanations of the techniques used.

To run the Jupyter notebooks locally, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can then clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/musfique113/PythonicPlayground.git
